# x402-next Example App

This is a Next.js application that demonstrates how to use the `x402-next` middleware to implement paywall functionality in your Next.js routes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v20+ (install via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- pnpm v10 (install via [pnpm.io/installation](https://pnpm.io/installation))
- A valid Ethereum address for receiving payments

## Setup

### Local Development

1. Copy `.env.local` to `.env` and add your Ethereum address to receive payments:

```bash
cp .env.local .env
```

2. Install and build all packages from the typescript examples root:
```bash
cd ../../
pnpm install
pnpm build
cd fullstack/next
```

3. Install and start the Next.js example:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Deployment to Vercel

This example is configured to deploy to Vercel using the published npm packages instead of workspace dependencies. To deploy:

1. Set your root directory to `x402/examples/typescript/fullstack/next` in Vercel
2. Configure the following environment variables in Vercel:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FACILITATOR_URL=https://x402.org/facilitator`
   - `NETWORK=base-sepolia` (or your preferred network)
   - `RESOURCE_WALLET_ADDRESS=` (your Ethereum address for receiving payments)
3. Deploy normally - Vercel will use npm and the published packages

## Example Routes

The app includes protected routes that require payment to access:

### Protected Page Route
The `/protected` route requires a payment of $0.01 to access. The route is protected using the x402-next middleware:

```typescript
// middleware.ts
import { paymentMiddleware, Network, Resource } from "x402-next";

const facilitatorUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FACILITATOR_URL as Resource;
const payTo = process.env.RESOURCE_WALLET_ADDRESS as Address;
const network = process.env.NETWORK as Network;

export const middleware = paymentMiddleware(
  payTo,
  {
    "/protected": {
      price: "$0.01",
      network,
      config: {
        description: "Access to protected content",
      },
    },
  },
  {
    url: facilitatorUrl,
  },
);

// Configure which paths the middleware should run on
export const config = {
  matcher: ["/protected/:path*"],
};
```

## Response Format

### Payment Required (402)
```json
{
  "error": "X-PAYMENT header is required",
  "paymentRequirements": {
    "scheme": "exact",
    "network": "base",
    "maxAmountRequired": "1000",
    "resource": "http://localhost:3000/protected",
    "description": "Access to protected content",
    "mimeType": "",
    "payTo": "0xYourAddress",
    "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60,
    "asset": "0x...",
    "outputSchema": null,
    "extra": null
  }
}
```

### Successful Response
```ts
// Headers
{
  "X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE": "..." // Encoded response object
}
```

## Extending the Example

To add more protected routes, update the middleware configuration:

```typescript
export const middleware = paymentMiddleware(
  payTo,
  {
    "/protected": {
      price: "$0.01",
      network,
      config: {
        description: "Access to protected content",
      },
    },
    "/api/premium": {
      price: "$0.10",
      network,
      config: {
        description: "Premium API access",
      },
    },
  }
);

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/protected/:path*", "/api/premium/:path*"],
};
```
